=== Current and capacity

Current measurements only accurate to \~10mA.

With 2 LEDs:

- both off: 10mA
- 1 red: 20mA
- 2 red: 40mA
- 1 white: 50mA
- 2 white: 100mA

Handwavey: all white: 50mA per LED at full brightness white.

We have 12 LEDs total (6 panels, 2 LEDs each). Small "lipstick" USB battery is
2200mAh, perhaps at 3.7V. So maybe \~8.14Wh. At 5V, that's \~1600mAh, or 2.6h
with all 12 LEDs at full brightness. This ignores any inefficiencies.
